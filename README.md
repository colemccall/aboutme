# Cole McCall

Hello, my name is Cole McCall, and I am currently seeking an entry-level role in software development or data science, preferably with an emphasis in GIS.

I graduate from Northwest Nazarene University in May 2023 with a major in Computer Science and concentrations in Data Science and Cyber Security. While attending NNU, my passion for working with software, data, and maps has continued to grow, with classes like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Big Data Management challenging me to learn more and apply my absolute best efforts and abilities.

Outside of the classroom, I have worked as a research assistant for over 2 years, where I have worked with my team to use drone and satellite imagery to solve geospatial problems, such as mapping and predicting wildfires, using AI and Machine Learning. Additionally, I have provided help to fellow students and my professors as a teacher’s assistant, where I learned just how true it is that you don’t always know something until you teach it to others.


# Projects
Ever since I began programming, I have discovered that I am someone that learns through doing, not just by watching and observing. As such, I have completed several projects during my college education, along with personal side projects and research projects that I have enjoyed. I have chosen to share a few of these projects here below.

## Artifical Intelligence
During the Spring 2021 semester, I signed up for NNU's COMP4220 Artificial Intelligence as a Sophomore Computer Science student. This was an amazing class for me, as I was really pushed, both conceptually and technically. Throughout the course, I developed programs in C++ that used AI, several of which can be seen down below. While these projects started as homework assignments, they quickly progressed into fun challenges that I wanted to solve and take above and beyond.

### Playing Connect Four with AI

## General Education Data Science
**Project Description:** During my Senior year, I started in a project in the Advanced Database Management course, which turned in a part-time project that I am still consulting/advising on. Based on course and student data stored in spreadsheets, our team of 3 was tasked with cleaning, storing, and finding patterns in the data, which was used to provide insights into which general education courses are being properly assessed, and how to predict this information in the future.
